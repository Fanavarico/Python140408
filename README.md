# Python Class Repository

Welcome 👋  

This repository contains the Python codes we write during our class sessions.  
Each session has its own folder, and inside you will find the related code examples we created on that day.  

## Structure
- `Session 1/` → Code from the first session  
- `Session 2/` → Code from the second session  
- ...and so on  

## Purpose
This repository is for students to:
- Review what we learned in class  
- Practice Python by running and modifying the examples  
- Track progress across sessions  

---

✨ Keep learning, keep coding, and enjoy Python!
